# Flappy Bird Game Using Pygame and NEAT

## Overview
A Flappy Bird-inspired game built with Python's `pygame`. The bird moves through pipes while gravity and user input control its motion. NEAT AI integration will allow the game to train an AI to play.

## Current Features (1/22/2025)
- **Game Window**: 600x800 pixels.
- **Graphics**: Animated bird (3 images), pipes, base, and background.
- **Bird Class**: Handles position, tilt, velocity, jumping, and movement (in progress).

## Next Steps
- Complete bird movement logic.
- Add pipe, ground movement, and collision.
- Integrate NEAT for AI training.

## How to Run
1. Install `pygame`: `pip install pygame`.
2. Place images in an `imgs` folder.
3. Run the script: `python flappy_bird.py`.
